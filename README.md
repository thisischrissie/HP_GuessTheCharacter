# Guess the Harry Potter Character
### Task
The assignment for the bootcamp was to create a console app on Python that interacts with an API of our choosing and pulls out data in a creative way. <br>
I decided to use a [Harry Potter characters API](https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters) which returns character objects with the keys `name`, `gender`, `alternate_names`, `actor`, `hairColour` etc. 

### Objective
My console app selects a character from the API at random and returns clues based around the character profile. The user then inputs their guess and the app tracks whether the guess is right or wrong. The user gets 5 attempts, and each time the clues get easier. 

### How to Use
On main.py run the script terminal to reveal the clues. Input your answers into the terminal. You must enter the character's full name e.g. the console won't accept just 'Dumbledore'. The scoring works as follows: <br>
Clue 1 = 10 points <br>
Clue 2 = 8 points <br>
Clue 3 = 6 points <br>
Clue 4 = 4 points <br>
Clue 5 = 2 points <br>
<br>
Good luck!
