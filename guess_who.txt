So you think you know your Harry Potter characters? 
The rules are simple, I will select a character at random and give you up to five clues. You can take a guess each time but if you get it wrong we proceed to the next clue. 
Beware, you ONLY get five clues; the first clue is worth TEN points to your house, the second clue is worth EIGHT points, all the way down to the final clue which is only worth a measley TWO points.
Good luck and type 'ALOHOMORA' to unlock your first clue:
